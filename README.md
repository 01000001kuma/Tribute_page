Tribute Page

This is my first project ever!

This project is an assignment for the Free Code Camp course.

This project is about my mom and I've built it using only HTML and CSS as the assignment required.

I hope you'll enjoy my code. But in this case, you probably won't because is messy and unstructured sorry ;)

If you have any questions or want to contact me please feel free to do so at a_illera@yahoo.com.
